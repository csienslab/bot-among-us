## Chatbots Usage

Chatbots in group chats on instant messaging services are automated programs designed to interact with users through text messages and simulate conversation with human users. Examples of popular platforms that support chatbots in their group chat functionalities include Slack, Discord, and Telegram. These platforms allow the integration of chatbots that can be customized to perform a wide range of actions, from managing workflows to engaging users in interactive conversations.

One of the primary functions of chatbots in group chats is to facilitate communication by offering quick responses to common queries. This can be particularly useful in customer service or support groups where chatbots provide instant answers to frequently asked questions, helping to streamline interactions and save time.

For example, in the following image, a chatbot asks a new user to pass a CAPTCHA challenge.

Another example is a moderation chatbot that bans users who send spam to the group.

In this section, you will be asked several questions about your experience using chatbots in group chats.

3. **Which of the following are considered chatbots in group chats and are therefore within the scope of this study? (Select all that apply)**

   * A chatbot in a customer support group on Telegram that provides instant answers to frequently asked questions.
   * A virtual assistant on your phone (e.g., Siri, Google Assistant).
   * A chatbot in Discord that facilitates interactive conversations among group members.
   * A large language model like ChatGPT used in a one-on-one conversation to generate text.
   * ChatGPT integrated into a group chat on Slack to provide automated responses to questions in real-time.

4. **How often do you notice chatbots in group chats, including seeing them send messages or actively searching for their existence?**

## Awareness of Chatbots in Groups

Groups in instant messaging can generally be categorized into two types, though the boundary between them isn't always clear-cut: **private** and **public** groups.

**Private groups** in instant messaging are typically small, made up of close friends, colleagues, or family, and are private, often requiring an invitation to join. These groups focus on more personal conversations between members who know each other well. Conversations are expected to remain confidential and accessible only to group members and should not be leaked.

**Public groups**, on the other hand, are open to anyone interested in the topic of the group, such as developers working on open source projects or local community discussions. These groups tend to be larger, have less restrictive access, and cover broader topics, making them useful for networking and sharing information on a larger scale. Because of their open nature, conversations in these groups are not expected to remain confidential.

Each type of group serves different purposes: private groups for personal, intimate conversations and public groups for broader, more open discussions.

In this section, we will ask you some questions about your experience using chatbots in group chats.

The following questions start with **private groups**:

9. **Please select the third option: “Sometimes.”**

* Always
* Usually
* Sometimes
* Rarely
* Never

10. **Have you ever noticed any chatbots in private group chats you have participated in?**

* Yes
* No
* Not sure

11. **How often do you check for the presence of chatbots whenever you join private group chats?**

* Always
* Usually
* Sometimes
* Rarely
* Never

12. **Please elaborate on your answer to the previous question.**
    \[Text field]

13. **When do you check for the presence of chatbots in a private group?** (Select all that apply)

* When I first join a group
* When a new bot is added into the group
* When a bot is removed from the group
* When I notice unusual activity in the group
* I check every now and then to see if anything has changed

---

We will now move on to **public groups**. The questions are exactly the same, but instead we will focus on public groups. A public group, by the previous definition, is an open forum for anyone interested in the group's topic, ideal for networking and sharing information broadly, often with little expectation of confidentiality.

14. **Have you ever noticed any chatbots in public group chats you have participated in?**

* Yes
* No
* Not sure

15. **How often do you check for the presence of chatbots whenever you join public group chats?**

* Always
* Usually
* Sometimes
* Rarely
* Never

16. **Please elaborate on your answer to the previous question.**
    \[Text field]

17. **When do you check for the presence of chatbots in a public group?** (Select all that apply)

* When I first join a group
* When a new bot is added into the group
* When a bot is removed from the group
* When I notice unusual activity in the group
* I check every now and then to see if anything has changed
