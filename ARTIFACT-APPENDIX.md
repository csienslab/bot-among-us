Paper title: **Bot Among Us: Exploring User Awareness and Privacy Concerns About Chatbots in Group Chats**

Requested Badge(s):
  - [v] **Available**
  - [v] **Functional**
  - [v] **Reproduced**


## Description (Required for all badges)
This artifact accompanies the paper *Bot Among Us: Exploring User Awareness and Privacy Concerns About Chatbots in Group Chats*, to appear in Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PoPETS), 2026.

The repository contains:
- `analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for reproducing our quantitative analysis.
- `Chatbot User Study Cleaned.csv`: anonymized survey dataset used in our analysis.
- `code.csv`: results of our qualitative thematic coding of open-ended survey responses.
- `figures/`: directory containing figures generated by `analysis.ipynb` that appear in the paper.
- `questionnaire.md`: full survey instrument, including consent form and all study questions.
- `question_id_mapping.csv`: mapping between survey question IDs and question text.

### Security/Privacy Issues and Ethical Concerns (Required for all badges)
The dataset contains anonymized responses from our online user study. All personal identifiers were removed before release. The study was approved by our Institutional Review Board (IRB), and all participants gave informed consent for their anonymized responses to be shared for research purposes.

## Basic Requirements

### Hardware Requirements
No special hardware requirements. Any laptop/desktop capable of running Docker and Jupyter is sufficient.

### Software Requirements (Required for Functional and Reproduced badges)

1. Operating System: Any OS that can run Docker (Linux/macOS/Windows).
2. Docker image: `jupyter/datascience-notebook`.

### Estimated Time and Storage Consumption

- Overall human time: ~10–15 minutes (clone/pull image + start container + run notebook).
- Overall compute time: ~1 minute to execute all cells.
- Disk space: ~3 GB for the Docker image + <10 MB for repo, data, and generated figures.

## Environment

### Accessibility
The artifact is hosted on a persistent Git repository on GitHub.  
Latest main branch: https://github.com/csienslab/bot-among-us

### Set up the environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/csienslab/bot-among-us.git
cd bot-among-us
docker pull jupyter/datascience-notebook:latest
docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 -v "${PWD}":/home/jovyan/work jupyter/datascience-notebook:latest
```

Then, visit the URL shown in the container logs (typically `http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=...`), then open `work/analysis.ipynb`.

Finally, execute the notebook by clicking `Kernel` → `Restart & Run All`.

### Testing the Environment
Launch the container as described, open the notebook, and execute all the cells. If no errors are encountered, the environment is successfully set up.

## Artifact Evaluation
Execute the notebook by clicking `Kernel` → `Restart & Run All`. The notebook should produce figures and tables consistent with the paper.

## Limitations
Qualitative coding artifacts not included in the analysis script. Please check `code.csv` for the coding results.
